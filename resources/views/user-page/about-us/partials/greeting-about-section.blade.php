                    established as an educational and training institution committed to developing skilled and competent
                    professionals in the fields of tourism, hospitality, and cruise ship industries.

                    As the global tourism industry continues to grow, the demand for professional, well-trained, and
                    internationally competent human resources is increasing. In response to this challenge, BALI CAK

                    We believe that education is not only about technical skills, but also about building strong
                    character, work ethics, discipline, and professionalism. Through an industry-oriented curriculum,
                    experienced instructors, and adequate training facilities, we are committed to providing
                    opportunities for young people in Bali and across Indonesia to achieve a successful future and
                    contribute to the advancement of the tourism industry at both national and international levels.
